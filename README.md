# REAL-TIME-STRESS-DETECTION-SYSTEM-USING-PPG-SENSOR-MACHINE-LEARNING
This project builds a real-time stress detection system using a PPG sensor and Arduino UNO R4. Pulse data is processed in Python to extract features and predict stress with a Random Forest model. Visual (LED) and email alerts provide instant, low-cost feedback for personal stress monitoring.
